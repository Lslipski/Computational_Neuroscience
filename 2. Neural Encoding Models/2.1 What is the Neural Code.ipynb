    "<b>Many Neurons</b>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> <b>fMRI</b>: allows us to record activity from people while they perform some (stationary)task. A magnet measures spatial perturbations in the field around the brain, which identifies changes in blood oxygenation. Provides measurements on the scale of about a $mm^3$. This represents the average activity of millions of neurons. Blood flow changes also happen slowly (time scale of seconds).<br>\n",
    "    <img src='fmri.jpg'><br>\n",
    "    <li><b>EEG</b>: captures changes in electical fields of underlying neural circuits. It is faster than fMRI, but still averages activity of many neurons at once. It uses a cap of electrodes. It provides a rather noisy signal. <br>\n",
    "    <img src='eeg.jpg'>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<b>Individual Neurons</b>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><b>Electrode Arrays</b>: when we have direct access to neural tissue, we can place this array of about 10-microns (512 electrodes, 60 microns apart), so many neurons can be recorded from simultaneously. In the image below, each electrode spike is about 2mm long and the tip of each one is an active electrode.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src='earray.png'><br>\n",
    "<li><b>Calcium Imaging</b>: A calcium indicator is put into the brain cells, which changes its flourescent properties when calcium binds to it. So the cell's flourescence is a measure of the amount of calcium in the cell. Because calcium enters the cell during an action potential, this signal represents the firing of the neuron. This can be used on up to millions of neurons at once.<br>\n",
    "<img src='calcium.jpg'><br>\n",
    "<li><b>Patch Electrodes</b>: this method allows the recoding of neuron activity from <i>inside</i> the cell by clamping an electrode onto the cell membrane. This is so valuable be cause the amplitude of the spike within the cell (change in voltages) is so much higher and therefore doesn't need to be amplified after collection.<br>\n",

When a vertical bar of spikes is observed at a particular time, a strong neural response is indicated. What a raster of many neurons shows is that each neuron is encoding some feature of the movie.<br>\n",
