    "\n",
    "<b>Gap junctions</b> are ion channels that span the membrane of two abutting neurons. This setup means that electical activity (like a spike) in one neuron will cause ions to rush through the channels into the connected other neuron. This leads to very fast connections between two neurons. These are typically found where sets of neurons are synchronized and in fast reflex mechanisms.\n",

These ions can then enter the subsequent neuron, changing the polarization. So the action potential goes from electical to chemical, back to electrical.\n",

    "This may be desirable because it allows for different levels of excitation to be created in the subsequent neuron by simply removing receptors for certain ions at the synapse. \n",
